# Cricket Minesweeper

## Introduction

Cricket Minesweeper is a game that combines the classic Minesweeper with cricket. It generates a customizable grid of 5x5, 6x6, or 7x7 size, where fielders are randomly placed. The player's goal is to score runs by selecting grid cells without encountering fielders. You have 3 wickets to defend, and your score depends on how many runs you accumulate before losing all your wickets.
